What code draws the blades of grass?
What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
What's the point of the h variable?
What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h)? Why is it there?

1.line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));

2.if (random(1000) > 999) { fill(255); rect(0, 0, width, height-15); h = 10; } Only if grass(1000) > 999

3.h controls the random hight

4.Make sure that each grass is limited.
